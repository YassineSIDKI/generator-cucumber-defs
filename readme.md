# Cucumber JS Step Definitions Generator

This tool transforms your undefined `.feature` files into JavaScript step
definitions â€“ because life is too short to copypasta them all the time.

Unlike other generators, this tool uses cucumber-js features directly to parse
and transform the gherkin syntax.
